## Project Title
Predicted Stock Price

## Project Team Members

#

## Project Objective 
  
My objective was to research and learn what prices is possible predict with skills obtained in this FinTech Bootcamp.  I used the Yahoo Finance API to Price 

following:  
- How do predicted stocks price on companies?  
- if I predicted price and sign signals, Is that useful?
- Call I want to know stock's price, each model's conclusion?

#

## Brief Background of Key Skills
As part of the U of MN FinTech Bootcamp, I have obtained the necessary skills to automate and improve financial services using cutting-edge technology.  Skills gained at the conclusion of Bootcamp include the following:

#

## Datasets Used
I used data obtained from the Yahoo Finance API.   
  
I selected the following skills obtained during this FinTech Bootcamp to use in our model:
1. Database
2. Python
3. API
4. Algorithm
5. SQL
6. Finance

 # 

## Training/Testing and Predictive Model Evaluation

I ran a variety of machine learning algorithms to determine the best model to use:
1. Linear Regression
2. LSTM
3. Random Forest
   
#

## Model Performance

Techniques used to evaluate the model performance included running various machine learning algorithms to determine the best model. The project was decided by comparing all three models to predict the stock price.


#

## Summary of Conclusions/Predictions

It is impossible to predict the exact price perfectly, but overall it is upward sloping. / I think it's good to think of it as a way to use machine learning. And It's a kind of basic how to use dataframe and control data.


#

## Conclusion

In all of LSTM, RandomForest, and LinearRegression, the real and predict price ​​flowed similarly. But LSTM is more flexible. Lots of function's value need to change again and agian. Because I had to keep trying to get the most similar real price. 
  
*Difficulties:*  
 It was difficult to get the overall function settings for lstm to work. And First time, Running machine learning, the gap between the real and predict price was too wide. And move the python's dataframe to postgresql, It is not easy to find the way.
  
*Potential Next Steps:*
automatically save all dataframes or results to sql server
